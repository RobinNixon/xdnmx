# Budget Templates

xDNMX events should be cheap to run. Here are sample budgets for different scales.

---

## Philosophy: Keep It Cheap

The best xDNMX events cost almost nothing. Why?

- **Low barrier** — Anyone can organize
- **Sustainable** — No burnout from fundraising
- **Focus on content** — Fancy venues don't make better discoveries
- **Accessible** — No need to charge admission

The core requirements (room, wifi, projector) are often free.

## Budget Levels

### Level 0: Zero Budget

**Total: $0**

| Item | Cost | Source |
|------|------|--------|
| Venue | $0 | Library, university, someone's home |
| Projector | $0 | Venue provides or someone brings one |
| Wifi | $0 | Venue provides |
| Food | $0 | BYOB (bring your own beverage/snacks) |
| Promotion | $0 | Social media, word of mouth |

**How to make it work:**

- **Marketing agencies** — Word of mouth works

- **Potluck** — Everyone brings something

### Sponsor Options

- **Local tech companies** — Often have community budgets

## Tips for Keeping Costs Down

1. **Book free venues early** — Libraries, universities fill up
2. **Partner with existing meetups** — Share venue costs
3. **Time it right** — Weekday evenings = cheaper venues
4. **Buy in bulk** — Costco pizza feeds many cheaply
5. **Skip the swag** — Stickers are nice but not essential
6. **Use free tools** — Google Forms, Eventbrite free, GitHub

## A Note on Tickets

If you charge for tickets:

- Keep it cheap ($5-10 max for regular events)
- Offer free tickets for students/unemployed
- Use no-questions-asked refunds
- Be transparent about where money goes

**Remember:** The goal is access. Price shouldn't be a barrier to someone who wants to figure things out.
