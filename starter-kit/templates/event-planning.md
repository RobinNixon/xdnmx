## Event Description Template

Copy and customize:

```
xDNMX [Your City] — Discovery → Building

Join us for an xDNMX session: where researchers share discoveries
and engineers figure out how to build on them.

[PRESENTER NAME] will share their work on [TOPIC], including the
AI-assisted methodology they used to explore the space. Then we'll
discuss, debate, and brainstorm implementations together.

**What is xDNMX?**
An extended network for foundational research in computation,
emergence, and intelligence. Not a conference. Not a hackathon.
Something new.

**What to expect:**
- 20 min: Discovery presentation
- 15 min: Discussion
- 20 min: Building proposals
- Remaining: Free-form collaboration

**Who should come:**
- Researchers with discoveries (or curiosity)
- Engineers who build foundational things
- Anyone who wants to figure things out

**What to bring:**
- Laptop (if you want to code)
- Curiosity (required)
- No credentials necessary

Results will be posted to the global xDNMX repo that night.

## Facilitator Script

Use this to kick things off:

```
Welcome to xDNMX [Your City]!

Quick intro: xDNMX is an extended network for foundational research
and building. The format is simple:

1. Someone shows what they found
2. We discuss and probe
3. Engineers propose how to build
4. We collaborate freely

Ground rules:
- Focus on ideas, not credentials
- Questions are encouraged
- "I don't know" is a valid answer
- We post results to GitHub tonight

Code of conduct is [posted/available]. Short version: be excellent
to each other.

Now, let me introduce [PRESENTER]...
```
