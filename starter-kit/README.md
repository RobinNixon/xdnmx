**Everything you need to run your own xDNMX event.**

## Quick Start

1. **Read the philosophy** — Understand what xDNMX is about
2. **Pick a date and venue** — A room, wifi, projector. That's it.
3. **Find your people** — Researchers with discoveries, engineers who build
4. **Use the templates** — Customize for your context
5. **Run the session** — Discovery → Discussion → Building
6. **Post to GitHub** — Connect to the global network that night

## The xDNMX Promise

When you run an xDNMX event, you're agreeing to:

- Keep it **open** — No gatekeepers, no credentials required
- Keep it **foundational** — Focus on *why*, not just *what*
- Keep it **connected** — Post results to the global repo
- Keep it **joyful** — For the fun of figuring it out
