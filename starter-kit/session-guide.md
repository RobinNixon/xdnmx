# How to Run a "Discovery → Building" Session

The core xDNMX format: someone shows what they found, someone else figures out how to build it. Here's how to make that happen.

## The Basic Flow

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   DISCOVERY     │  Researcher presents finding
│   (20 min)      │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   DISCUSSION    │  Group asks questions, probes assumptions
│   (15 min)      │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   BUILDING      │  Engineers propose implementations
│   (20 min)      │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   CHAOS         │  Free-form collaboration
│   (remaining)   │
└─────────────────┘
```

## Before the Session

### Find a Discovery

The session needs something to build on. Options:

1. **A researcher with new findings** — Someone who's done AI-assisted research and has a repo to show
2. **A paper from Submissions** — Browse the [xDNMX Submissions](https://github.com/RobinNixon/xdnmx/discussions/categories/submissions) for inspiring work
3. **A question worth exploring** — Sometimes the session generates the discovery live

### Prepare the Room

- Projector or large screen (for showing repos and code)
- Whiteboard or flip chart (for sketching ideas)
- Good wifi (people will be browsing repos)
- Power strips (laptops need juice)
- Casual seating arrangement (circles > rows)

### Set Expectations

Tell participants in advance:
- Bring laptops if you want to build
- No credentials required — just curiosity
- Results get posted to GitHub that night

## Running the Session

### Part 1: Discovery (20 minutes)

The researcher presents their finding. This is NOT a traditional talk.

**Format:**
- Show the GitHub repo on screen
- Walk through the key discovery
- Demonstrate the AI-assisted methodology
- Show the evidence (outputs, experiments, data)

**The presenter should answer:**
- What did you find?
- How did you find it? (AI methodology)
- Why does it matter?
- What's still unknown?

**Tips:**
- Keep slides minimal — the repo is the presentation
- Show actual code and outputs
- Be honest about limitations
- Leave time for questions

### Part 2: Discussion (15 minutes)

The group probes the discovery. This is collaborative, not adversarial.

**Good questions:**
- "What would break this theory?"
- "Have you tried X variation?"
- "What's the simplest case where this works?"
- "What's the boundary condition?"

**Facilitator role:**
- Keep it focused on understanding, not critiquing
- Make space for quiet people to speak
- Redirect tangents gently
- Watch the clock

### Part 3: Building (20 minutes)

Engineers propose how to implement or extend the discovery.

**Format:**
- Open floor for proposals
- Sketch on whiteboard
- Identify quick wins vs. ambitious projects
- Form ad-hoc teams around interesting ideas

**Questions to spark building:**
- "What's the simplest implementation of this?"
- "What existing tool could this improve?"
- "What would a proof-of-concept look like?"
- "What's the first thing to try?"

### Part 4: Chaos (remaining time)

The best part. People break into groups, start coding, argue productively, discover new questions.

**Facilitator role:**
- Get out of the way
- Connect people who should talk
- Keep pizza/drinks flowing
- Take notes on what emerges

## After the Session

### That Night

Post results to the xDNMX repo. This is non-negotiable — it's how local events connect globally.

**What to post:**
- Summary of the discovery discussed
- Building ideas that emerged
- Any repos created during the session
- Photos (with consent)
- Key insights or questions

**Where to post:**
- Use the appropriate [Discussions category](https://github.com/RobinNixon/xdnmx/discussions)
- If new repos were created, submit them to Submissions

### Follow Up

- Share contact info among participants
- Create a group chat for continued collaboration
- Schedule the next session while energy is high

---

## Variations

### Lightning Round

Multiple discoveries, shorter presentations:
- 5 min presentation
- 5 min questions
- 10 min building discussion
- Repeat 3-4 times
- Extended chaos at the end

### Build-First

Start with a building challenge, discover the theory needed:
- "How would we build X?"
- What foundational questions does this raise?
- Research live during the session

### Remote/Hybrid

Can work, but harder:
- Use screen sharing heavily
- Have a dedicated chat moderator
- Break into smaller video rooms for chaos phase
- Harder to achieve the magic, but possible

## Common Problems

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Presenter talks too long | Agree on strict timing; use a visible timer |
| Discussion becomes adversarial | Redirect to "help me understand" framing |
| Engineers dominate | Explicitly invite researchers to respond |
| Nobody has building ideas | Have 2-3 seed ideas prepared |
| Chaos phase is awkward | Seed it by pairing people explicitly |
| Nothing gets posted | Assign someone to post before session ends |

---

## The Secret

The magic happens in the space between disciplines. A researcher says something that seems obvious to them. An engineer hears it differently. Something new emerges.

Your job as facilitator is to create that space and protect it.

**Discovery → Discussion → Building → Chaos → GitHub. That's the loop.**
