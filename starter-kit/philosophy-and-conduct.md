# Philosophy & Code of Conduct

## The xDNMX Philosophy

### Why We Exist

The deepest discoveries often stay trapped in papers. The best engineering sometimes lacks foundations. xDNMX exists to bridge that gap — connecting people who find things with people who build things.

### Core Beliefs

**Anyone can contribute.**
No PhD required. No institution required. No permission required. The work speaks for itself. A teenager in a garage and a professor at MIT compete on equal footing: show your repo, let peers decide.

**Foundational over incremental.**
We care about *why* things work, not just *what* they do. An app is nice. Understanding the principle that makes the app possible is xDNMX.

**Open source or it didn't happen.**
If it's not on GitHub with an open license, it doesn't count. Reproducibility isn't optional — it's the whole point. Science that can't be verified isn't science.

**AI-powered research is the methodology of this moment.**
Human intuition identifies what's interesting. AI exhaustively explores the space. Together, they find things neither could find alone. This is how discovery works now.

**Researchers and engineers together.**
The best outcomes happen when someone who found something sits next to someone who can build it. Not sequential. Simultaneous. In the same room.

**Joy matters.**
If you're not having fun figuring things out, something is wrong. Curiosity is the engine. Wonder is the fuel. The best xDNMX events feel like play.

## Code of Conduct

### The Short Version

Be excellent to each other. Focus on the work. Make it safe for anyone to contribute.

### The Detailed Version

#### Expected Behavior

- **Assume good faith.** People are here to learn and contribute.
- **Focus on ideas, not people.** Critique the work, not the person.
- **Welcome newcomers.** Everyone started somewhere.
- **Share credit generously.** Collaboration > competition.
- **Ask questions.** There are no stupid questions, only unexplored territory.
- **Admit uncertainty.** "I don't know" is a valid and respected answer.

#### Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Dismissing people based on credentials (or lack thereof)
- Gatekeeping who "belongs" in research or engineering
- Claiming credit for others' work
- Closed-source submissions (defeats the entire purpose)
- Being a jerk (you know what this means)

#### For Event Organizers

- Make the code of conduct visible and accessible
- Have a clear process for reporting issues
- Act promptly on valid concerns
- Create space for diverse voices
- Remember: the goal is discovery, not hierarchy

#### Enforcement

At events:
1. First violation: Private conversation with organizer
2. Second violation: Asked to leave the event
3. Severe violations: Immediate removal, potential ban from future events

Online:
1. Content removal or editing
2. Temporary suspension from discussions
3. Permanent ban for repeated or severe violations

#### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
- At an event: Find an organizer immediately
- Online: Email info@xdnmx.org or use GitHub's reporting tools
- All reports are confidential

## Attribution

This code of conduct is inspired by:
- The Contributor Covenant
- The Recurse Center's social rules
- The scientific tradition of open inquiry

**The goal is simple: make it safe and fun to figure things out together.**
