## Logo

### The Mark

The xDNMX logo is a geometric design using black triangles on white:

![xDNMX Logo](./logo/logo.png)

- **Left side:** Triangles forming a ">" or "D" shape (pointing right — discovery)
- **Right side:** Triangles forming an "X" shape (extended, multiplication)

The design represents:
- Extended (like TEDx — anyone can run an event)
- The unknown (what we're searching for)
- Discovery → Building (the arrow pointing to the X)

### Logo Versions

1. **Primary:** Black on white (current)
2. **Inverted:** White on dark backgrounds (create as needed)
3. **With text:** Logo + "xDNMX" wordmark (create as needed)

### Construction

- Geometric triangles on a roughly square canvas
- Current file: 748 x 710 pixels
- Maintain aspect ratio when scaling

### Clear Space

Maintain clear space equal to the height of the "x" on all sides.

```
      ┌─────────────────────┐
      │                     │
      │    x D N M X        │
      │                     │
      └─────────────────────┘
         ↑ clear space = x height
```

### Minimum Size

- Digital: 24px height minimum
- Print: 0.5 inches / 12mm height minimum

### Don'ts

- Don't stretch or compress
- Don't rotate
- Don't add drop shadows or effects
- Don't place on busy backgrounds
- Don't change the colors outside the palette
- Don't rearrange elements

## Imagery

### Photography Style

- **Candid over posed** — real people doing real work
- **Diverse** — anyone, anywhere means *anyone, anywhere*
- **Technical environments** — whiteboards, screens, notebooks
- **Warm lighting** — inviting, not sterile

### Illustrations

- **Simple diagrams** over complex graphics
- **Hand-drawn elements** welcome (authenticity)
- **ASCII art** for technical charm
- **Network/connection** motifs

### Screenshots

- Show real repos, real code, real discussions
- Blur or redact personal information
- Dark mode screenshots preferred (technical credibility)

---

## Voice & Tone

### Voice (consistent)

- **Direct** — Say what you mean
- **Technical** — Precise language, no buzzwords
- **Inclusive** — "Anyone can contribute"
- **Curious** — Questions are good

### Tone (varies by context)

| Context | Tone |
|---------|------|
| Announcements | Energetic, exciting |
| Documentation | Clear, helpful |
| Code of conduct | Warm but firm |
| Research discussion | Rigorous, open |

### Writing Guidelines

- Use "we" and "you" (not "the organization" or "users")
- Avoid jargon unless necessary
- Short sentences. Short paragraphs.
- Active voice over passive
- Questions are welcome in copy
