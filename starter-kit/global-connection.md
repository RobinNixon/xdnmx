# Connecting to the Global Network

The "x" in xDNMX means extended — your local event is part of a worldwide network. Here's how to connect.

---

## Why Connect?

Your local event generates value. The global network multiplies it.

- **Visibility** — Your discoveries reach researchers worldwide
- **Collaboration** — Engineers anywhere can build on local findings
- **Recognition** — Great work gets nominated for prizes
- **Continuity** — Ideas persist beyond a single evening
- **Community** — You're not alone in this

---

## The Connection Points

### 1. GitHub Discussions

The main hub for the global network: [github.com/RobinNixon/xdnmx/discussions](https://github.com/RobinNixon/xdnmx/discussions)

| Category | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| Discoveries | Someone presented research worth sharing |
| Builds | An implementation emerged from your event |
| Collaborations | Seeking help: "We found X, need engineer for Y" |
| Questions | "Has anyone explored X?" |
| Submissions | Formal prize submissions |
| Nominations | "This work deserves recognition" |

### 2. Event Reports

After every event, post a summary. This is the minimum viable connection.

**Template:**

```markdown
# xDNMX [Your City] — [Date]

## Event Summary
- **Attendees:** [Number]
- **Location:** [City, Country]
- **Theme:** [If any]

## Discovery Presented
[One paragraph summary]
- **Presenter:** [Name/handle]
- **Repo:** [Link]
- **Key finding:** [One sentence]

## Building Ideas
- [Idea 1]
- [Idea 2]

## What Emerged
[Any repos, collaborations, or follow-ups]

## Next Event
[Date or "Planning now"]
```

### 3. Submissions

If someone presents work worthy of recognition:

1. Encourage them to submit to [Submissions](https://github.com/RobinNixon/xdnmx/discussions/categories/submissions)
2. Include: repo link, one-paragraph summary, why it matters
3. The community engages — stars, forks, discussions

### 4. Nominations

See great work at your event? Nominate it.

Post to [Nominations](https://github.com/RobinNixon/xdnmx/discussions/categories/nominations):
- Link to the work
- Why it deserves recognition
- Which prize category (Discovery, Bridge, Build)

## Staying Connected

### Join the Conversation

- **Watch the repo** — Get notified of new discussions
- **Star interesting work** — Signal quality to others
- **Comment thoughtfully** — Build relationships

### Share Your Events

Before your event:
- Post in Discussions to announce it
- Use #xDNMX on social media
- Tag @xdnmx if/when accounts exist

After your event:
- Post the summary (required)
- Share any repos created
- Cross-link related discussions

### Connect Events

Meeting someone at your event who's from another city? Connect them:
- "You should talk to the xDNMX Berlin folks about this"
- Share discussion links across events
- Introduce organizers to each other

---

## The Global Calendar

*(Coming soon)*

We're building a calendar of xDNMX events worldwide. For now:
- Post your event dates in Discussions
- Check Discussions for events in your area

---

## Cross-Event Collaboration

### Scenario: Discovery in Tokyo, Building in Toronto

1. Tokyo event: Researcher presents finding, posts to Discussions
2. Toronto engineer sees it: "I could build that"
3. Toronto event: Engineer presents implementation plan
4. Collaboration forms across timezones
5. Both events benefit

### Scenario: Same Research, Different Angles

1. Berlin event explores computation theory
2. São Paulo event explores same theory from different angle
3. Both post findings
4. Combined insights emerge from comparison

### Making it Happen

- **Post everything** — You never know what sparks connection
- **Reference other events** — "Building on what xDNMX Tokyo found..."
- **Invite remote participation** — Share links before events
- **Follow up** — When you see related work, comment

---

## For Recurring Events

If you're running regular xDNMX events:

### Create a Local Identity

- Name: xDNMX [City]
- Consider a local GitHub org for your community's work
- Build a mailing list or chat group

### Maintain Continuity

- Reference previous events in discussions
- Track which ideas evolved over time
- Celebrate when local discoveries get built

### Feed the Global Network

- Submit your best work
- Nominate standout contributors
- Share what's working (and what isn't)

---

## Recognition

The global network recognizes great work through:

### Annual Prizes

| Prize | For |
|-------|-----|
| Discovery | Best foundational insight |
| Bridge | Best research-engineering collaboration |
| Build | Best foundational implementation |

### Community Recognition

- Stars and forks on GitHub
- Comments and engagement
- Invitations to present at other events
- Reputation in the network

### Event Organizer Recognition

Great organizers get:
- Mentioned in annual wrap-ups
- Connected to resources and other organizers
- First access to new materials and tools

---

## Questions?

- **General questions:** Post in Discussions
- **Organizer questions:** Email info@xdnmx.org
- **Technical issues:** Open an issue on the repo

---

## The Network Effect

One event is interesting. Ten events are a movement. A hundred events change how research and building happen.

Every time you connect your local event to the global network, you strengthen both. The discovery in your city might inspire a build on another continent. The engineer at your event might solve a problem someone posted last month.

**That's the power of extended dynamics.**

**Post tonight. Connect tomorrow. Build together.**
