# xDNMX — Extended Dynamics

**From Discovery to Building**

xDNMX = Extended Dynamics (badly spelled, fully intentional).

The extended network for foundational research in computation, emergence, and intelligence — brought to life by researchers and engineers working together, powered by AI. Anyone, anywhere.

## What is xDNMX?

Not a conference. Not a hackathon. Something new.

An extended network where foundational discoveries meet the people who can build on them. Local events, global connections. Anyone, anywhere can participate.

**We believe:**
- The deepest discoveries need builders, and the best engineering needs foundations
- Anyone can contribute — singles, labs, teams, wherever you are
- Open source or it didn't happen
- AI-powered research is the methodology of this moment
- It should be fun

## 🔬 For Researchers

Use AI (Claude Code or equivalent) to build defensible papers. Show your discovery. Show the exhaustive exploration. Show what you found.

**Requirements:**
- Public GitHub repository
- Open source license (MIT, Apache, GPL, BSD, CC-BY)
- AI-assisted methodology
- Reproducible, verifiable findings
- Clear README explaining your discovery

---

## 🛠️ For Engineers

Build something foundational. Turn a discovery into reality — whether your own insight or inspired by existing research. Browse submitted papers for ideas, or bring your own.

**Requirements:**
- Public GitHub repository  
- Open source license (MIT, Apache, GPL, BSD, CC-BY)
- Foundational focus — not just an app, but *why* it works
- Workable implementation or proof of concept
- Clear README explaining the foundation you're building on

## 📬 How to Submit Your Work

**No gatekeepers. No endorsement required. Peers decide worth.**

1. **Create your repo** with your research or build
2. **Add an open source license** (MIT, Apache, GPL, BSD, CC-BY)
3. **Post to Discussions** under [📬 Submissions](../../discussions/categories/submissions)
4. **Include:**
   - Link to your repo
   - One-paragraph summary of what you found/built
   - Why it matters

That's it. The community engages. Stars, forks, issues, builds. The work proves itself.

## 🏆 Prizes

Annual recognition for foundational work. Not money — capability.

| Prize | For | Reward |
|-------|-----|--------|
| 🔬 **Discovery** | Best foundational insight | 12 months API credits |
| 🌉 **Bridge** | Best research-engineering collaboration | 6 months API credits (each) |
| 🛠️ **Build** | Best foundational implementation | 6 months API credits |

Plus recognition, a physical trophy, and connection to the community.

## 🌍 Run Your Own xDNMX Event

The "x" means extended. Like TEDx, anyone can run an xDNMX event.

**What you need:**
- A room (library, makerspace, someone's garage)
- Wifi and a projector
- People who want to figure things out
- Pizza optional but recommended

**Event format:**
1. Researcher shows what they found
2. Engineer says "I could build that"
3. Discussion, collaboration, chaos
4. Post results to this repo that night

Coming soon: The xDNMX Starter Kit with templates, brand assets, and guides.

## The Origin

xDNMX began with a simple question: *"How many switches does it take to compute?"*

What followed was seven papers, thousands of AI-powered experiments, and a complete theory of how complexity emerges from simple rules — Substrate Complexity Theory.

That work showed what's possible when curiosity meets exhaustive exploration. xDNMX exists to find more people doing the same, and connect them with builders who can bring discoveries to life.

**The founding papers:**
1. Hidden State as Mechanism
2. Self-Maintenance as Default  
3. Engineering Self-Maintenance
4. Universal Computation Threshold
5. Constraint Dynamics
6. Temporal Invariants
7. Substrate Complexity Theory (Synthesis)

---

## Values

- **Anyone** — No credentials required. The work speaks.
- **Foundational** — We care about *why*, not just *what*.
- **Open** — GitHub, not arXiv. Open source, always.
- **AI-Powered** — Human intuition × AI exploration = discovery.
- **Collaborative** — Researchers and engineers together.
- **Joyful** — For the fun of figuring it out.
